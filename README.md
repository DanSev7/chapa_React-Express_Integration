# Chapa React-Express Integration
## First make sure you clone the project
1. React setup : here I created an order Print button that calls api to the express backend
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Express setup : here we have two functions 1 for initiate payment and the other one is for verify payment
   ### But here you can also use webhook to replace the verify payment method 
   ```
   npm install
   ```
